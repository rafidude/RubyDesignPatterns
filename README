Ruby is the first dynamic language I started learning. I tried learning Python as well but the inherent sweetness of Ruby made me decide to really master Ruby.

Ruby is an easy language to learn. Simply install Ruby, start up irb command line ruby interpreter and type or execute code. However mastering Ruby is difficult. When I tried reading Rails or even Sinatra source code, I recognized huge gaps in my understanding of Ruby language. So I started reading Ruby books.
